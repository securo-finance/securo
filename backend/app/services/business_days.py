"""Business days, for schedules that follow the bank calendar.

A salary paid on the fifth business day, or a bill that moves off a holiday,
cannot be written as a calendar day: the fifth business day is the 5th one
month and the 9th the next. This module answers the one question those rules
need, *is this a day money moves?*, and the two that follow from it.

A holiday calendar is a country code, optionally with a subdivision after a
hyphen: ``BR``, ``BR-SP``, ``US-NY``, ``PT-30``. The days themselves come from
the ``holidays`` package, which computes them offline for every country it
supports, so a self-hosted install never calls out to a holiday API. Only a
country's public holidays count; the optional and observance categories are
days the banks still open.

Brazil adds its bank calendar on top: FEBRABAN closes the clearing system on
days that are not public holidays in law. A schedule without a calendar
treats every weekday as a business day, which is what it did before this
module.
